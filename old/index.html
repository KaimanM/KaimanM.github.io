          <h1>About me</h1>
      <br>
          <p> I like to build computers, a lot more than the average person. I have a knack for problem solving and troubleshooting and more often than not will spend the better half of a day, or night, figuring something out. Competitive E-Sports are a strong passion of mine, as are traditional sports. When I was younger I wanted to help develop RuneScape and somehow on that bumpy path I’ve ended up with a Computer Science degree. </p>
